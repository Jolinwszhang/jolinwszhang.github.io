*My Life*

Currently, I am a junior studying at the Shidler College of Business, with the intention of double majoring in Marketing and Management Information Systems.
Alongside my educational studies, I have gained valuable experience by working in hospitality as a Front Desk Agent for Hotel Renew and Lotus Honolulu at Diamond Head. 
I was able to demonstrate my ability to provide people with excellent customer service while maintaining professionalism and attention to detail. 
Additionally, I interned at Kolohe, a small jewelry company, as a marketing intern, developing entrepreneurship skills in digital marketing, design, and interpersonal and communication.



## Goals

My overall goal is to work for a technology company as a product manager, information technology manager, or data analytics.
In order for me to pursue these careers, I plan to take on as many opportunities that come my way to learn and grow. 
Becoming an Information Technology Manager and Data Analytics interests me in learning new things as technology is consistently growing.
As for product manager, this role aligns with my goals and personality as I am enthusiastic and creative. 
Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have demonstrated a strong commitment to personal and professional growth through my enthusiasm and willingness to learn. 
I am always willing to seek new challenges and find ways to expand my skill set while helping others.
