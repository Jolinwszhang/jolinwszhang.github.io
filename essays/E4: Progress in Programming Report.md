*Introduction*
Describing how my programming skills have significantly advanced is quite challenging. Initially, I never imagined myself delving into anything related to computers. However, reflecting on my journey, I've formulated seven questions that encapsulate my transformation.

## Programming Skills 
I'd say my programming skills have reached a point where I can create quite a bit without relying heavily on AI assistance. When I first started learning, though, I struggled with reading and understanding the concepts. I found that using notes and other resources to guide me while coding was really helpful.

One area where I've noticed significant improvement is in my typing and error handling. Initially, my typing skills were terrible—I'd frequently misspell words and make errors, like consistently misspelling "localhost:8080" when working with servers. I'd often blame my JavaScript or HTML code when, in reality, the issue was just a typo.

Being someone with poor typing skills, I used to find myself constantly redoing my code due to errors. However, I've since become better at analyzing the problem and identifying what's going wrong with my code before jumping to conclusions.

Another challenge I faced was writing clean and readable code. Initially, I struggled to keep my code organized and understandable. Now, when I write code, I make an effort to include small comments to explain each line's purpose, like "// header for the top" or "// footer subscribe button".

Overall, while I've had my struggles, I'm proud of the progress I've made. It's gratifying to see how much I've improved, and I'm excited to continue learning and growing as a programmer.

## Improvement  
I highly recommend focusing on understanding all the small coding details and formulas. When I first started, I was completely lost on commands like "cd .." or "ls," even the most basic ones. It took me a while to grasp concepts like looping and creating buttons. I had to break down every aspect of the code into smaller parts to comprehend it.

For me, understanding something means breaking down every sentence into individual words. Even a simple sentence like "I love my dog Milo" needs to be broken down into who I'm talking about, why I love them, and what they do.

One thing I'm eager to master is readability and the ability to continuously learn new trends and step out of my comfort zone. While I'm learning a lot, I find it challenging to adapt to new concepts. However, it's crucial for me to do this to gain a better understanding of fundamental programming concepts and principles. Otherwise, I won't be able to solve problems independently.

## Learning from WODs 
I'll be honest, WODs were tough for me, and even the TAs could tell from watching mine. Sometimes, I'd be working on them from 11 PM to 3 AM—that's the reality! Unless you're already familiar with a task or can recall every lab you've done, you're bound to encounter difficulties. Personally, timing was a struggle. I often only had time to work on them at night after finishing work and school, so I'd be battling fatigue.

However, using screencasts was a game-changer. They helped me understand the material better, especially when deciphering the lab steps. Breaking them down into manageable chunks was key.

One great tip I received was to attempt the WOD without the screencast first and then try it on my own. I found that talking through the process as if I were teaching someone else was helpful. Sometimes, it felt like I was struggling to learn, but the process became smoother over time.

Here's a tip: if you ever get stuck, don't hesitate to ChatGPT it. I've had moments where I attempted a WOD multiple times before realizing I made a tiny mistake, but it ultimately led to faster completion times and a deeper understanding of the task.

Keep pushing through those challenges—they're making you a stronger programmer in the long run!

## Labs and Confidence  
I'll be completely honest—the labs were a mixed bag for me. While I found them enjoyable in class, tackling them solo outside of class was nerve-wracking. I was constantly worried about making mistakes or missing something crucial.

That's where having a lab buddy made all the difference. Working together not only eased the pressure but also made the process more fun. We'd bounce ideas off each other, troubleshoot problems together, and even challenge each other to go the extra mile. Whether it was diving into extra credit assignments or refining CSS styles, having a buddy by my side made the labs feel less daunting.

One thing I particularly enjoyed was adding a personal twist to the labs. Whether it was decorating a website with custom graphics or adding flair to our server configurations, injecting our own creativity into the projects made them feel more like our own. Plus, it reinforced our understanding of the material in a way that just following instructions couldn't.

Despite the occasional bumps along the way, completing the labs has been incredibly rewarding. Not only have they helped me solidify my understanding of the concepts, but they've also given me a sense of accomplishment and confidence in my abilities. 

## Learning with Assignment 1  
I struggled quite a bit with the website assignment. However, once I finally got everything to work, there was a sense of satisfaction in designing and polishing everything. Even though I'm not entirely sure if I covered everything needed or if I feel completely accomplished, I've spent three days tirelessly working on it and resolving issues with my website.

Moving forward to Assignment 2, I believe I'll be ready as long as I receive occasional guidance from the TA and professor. Ideally, the tasks will align with what we've already learned. Assignment 1 was a significant learning experience for me, and I feel more equipped to take on new challenges. Here's to hoping for a smoother journey with Assignment 2!

## Improvement  
I really appreciate the structured approach of our lectures and assignments. However, I do wish we had more time for direct interaction with the professor during class. Sometimes, I hesitate to ask for assistance because I worry about slowing down the pace for everyone else. But once I understand a concept, I'm confident I can contribute effectively.

Feeling hesitant to ask questions is common, but it's important to remember that seeking clarification is essential for learning. I'm sure many of my classmates share similar concerns, so speaking up could benefit everyone.

If I need extra support, I'll consider reaching out to the professor outside of class. Many professors are willing to help students outside of scheduled hours.

## Helps me the most 
Personally, my biggest challenge is getting one-on-one help or working with a classmate. Without assistance, I tend to fall behind significantly. I find it difficult to learn without individualized instruction, especially if I'm struggling with a concept. ChatGPT has been instrumental in helping me understand what I'm doing wrong. I can ask questions quickly and receive prompt responses and suggestions for improvement. Having this resource has been invaluable in my learning journey.


I hope you are doing great.Just know that the best help will be the people around you.
