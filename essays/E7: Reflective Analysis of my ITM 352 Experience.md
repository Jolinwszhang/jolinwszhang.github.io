Course Goals ITM 352 has the following goals:
**Acquiring basic programming skills in an IT context**
After taking this class, I can safely say that I have grasped the programming concepts and technqiues using JSON, HTML, CSS. Especiallay with the use of css as it was one of the things where we had to contiouslsy change with trial and error. From the WODs and Assignments, it allowed me to build basic knowledge of the syntac to more complex algorithm like Assignmnet 1 and Assignmnet 2, where I was able to demostrate a good amount of my knowledge and implementation with for example login and authentication. 

Although I have not mastered any of the langauges, being able to learn and improve as I was taking the class really helped me learn some new skills that I am good at and bad at.

**Understanding why MIS people need basic programming skills and knowledge**
I persoanlly think the reason why MIS people need basic programming skills and knowledge is to know how to address any issues that may come our way in the future with web designing or how to analyze a problem. From this class, I can safely say that I have been able to now solve problems when it comes to me and also testing to see why or where I went wrong. An example could be a code loop that I wrote for a Wod that took me maybe 7 - 10 tries. 

From all of my classes I would say this class is highly important when it comes to knowing the knowledge of basic programming skills and knowledge for MIS majors or people. Being able to problem solve a code or troubleshoot along the way during a job or internship seems to be helpful. Overall being able to decipher things and explain back to a potential custoemr is also importnat 

**Gaining hands-on experience in developing software applications**
I think all of the things we have done from labs to WODs to Assignmnets have really allowed me to gain those hands on experiences. From WODs, I was able to watch how to do things and learn from what I could have done differently or work to improve the code. 

Using Labs and Assignments on the other hand felt more like it was all instructional and would be guided half way and then we would be told to have to learn the information while we are taking our time to devlop software applications. Just because there was small sections where we are told to have to " do it on our own". 

From this, I think it really helped me problem solve and think on my own because everyone has a different way of applying a code and it can be done in so many different ways so figuring out my rytheme or the steps that work the best with me was the most valuble lesson I had learned. 

**Experiencing first-hand MIS problems and solutions**
From my personal experience, I felt like I had esxperienced so much first-hand MIS problems that I couldnt figure out until I divided all the steps one by one. From finding small mispelled sytax to inproper placements to even possibly the wrong file. The biggest hardship that I had encountered was my spelling. 

When I first started this class, I would even spell the word localhost wrong and it frustrated me when i was trying to load the server. Now, I felt lik I am able to detect those small spelling mistakes. 

**Experiencing and understanding first-hand project management, working in teams, software development issues**
From the firtst hand project managment and team working, I realized how time is very valuble when it comes to anything. Although it took me so long to realize, It helped me manage my time when It came to testings the proejcts like Assignment 1. I used a check list to mark down thigs that I had done and made sure to complete a certain part of the project before moving to the next. An example could me adding the home.html then home.js in cocurence updating the server. 

Especially without the help of my collaboartion with my teamartes or fellow classmates, I do not think i would have been able to strive in the class. Working with a team help me get more ideas or another prospective on how to make the code I have better.

**Gaining confidence in addressing MIS problems**
I wouldn't say I have gained a lot of confidence when addressintg a MIS problem but I would say I can now find out where to first look if I came into a troubleshootintg error. 
For each of the above goals, explain what stands out in your class experience that indicates you have met that goal. You do not need to be comprehensive but do be specific. You should make each goal a sub-section.
Here is an example of what you might write:

What did you learn from creating a professional portfolio and using it in ITM 352?
What did you gain from doing the WODs?
Were the quizzes helpful in preparing you for the labs?
What did you learn from doing the labs?
What did you learn from doing the essays?
What did you learn from doing Assignment 1 and Assignment 2?
Challenges and Achievements
Detail the specific challenges you encountered during the course, such as understanding new programming concepts, completing WODs, web application development assignments.
Explain how you overcame these challenges and the strategies that helped you succeed.
Highlight any particular achievements or milestones in the course that were significant to you.
Skill Development and Application
Reflect on the three skill levels outlined in the course (syntactic, algorithmic, application) and discuss your progression through these levels.
Describe how the hands-on experience with web-based e-service applications enhanced your understanding and confidence in handling MIS issues.
Use of AI (e.g. ChatGBT)
Discuss how use of AI enhanced your learning and productivity. Give specific examples of how you used AI effectively.
Discuss how use of AI inhibited your learning or and productivity. Give specific examples of how you used AI ineffectively.
Future Implications and Professional Growth
Explore how the skills and knowledge gained from ITM 352 can be applied in your future academic and professional endeavors.
Discuss the potential impacts these skills will have on your career, especially in terms of understanding and addressing MIS problems.
Reflect on the overall value of the course in your educational journey and future career.
