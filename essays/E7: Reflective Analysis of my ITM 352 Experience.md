Course Goals ITM 352 has the following goals:
**Acquiring basic programming skills in an IT context**
After taking this class, I can safely say that I have grasped the programming concepts and technqiues using JSON, HTML, CSS. Especiallay with the use of css as it was one of the things where we had to contiouslsy change with trial and error. From the WODs and Assignments, it allowed me to build basic knowledge of the syntac to more complex algorithm like Assignmnet 1 and Assignmnet 2, where I was able to demostrate a good amount of my knowledge and implementation with for example login and authentication. 

**Understanding why MIS people need basic programming skills and knowledge**
I persoanlly think the reason why MIS people need basic programming skills and knowledge is to know how to address any issues that may come our way in the future with web designing or how to analyze a problem. From this class, I can safely say that I have been able to now solve problems when it comes to me and also testing to see why or where I went wrong. An example could be a code loop that I wrote for a Wod that took me maybe 7 - 10 tries. 

**Gaining hands-on experience in developing software applications**
Experiencing first-hand MIS problems and solutions
Experiencing and understanding first-hand project management, working in teams, software development issues
Gaining confidence in addressing MIS problems
For each of the above goals, explain what stands out in your class experience that indicates you have met that goal. You do not need to be comprehensive but do be specific. You should make each goal a sub-section.
