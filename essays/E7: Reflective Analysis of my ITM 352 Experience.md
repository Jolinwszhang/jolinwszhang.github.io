Course Goals ITM 352 has the following goals:
**Acquiring basic programming skills in an IT context**
After taking this class, I can safely say that I have grasped the programming concepts and technqiues using JSON, HTML, CSS. Especiallay with the use of css as it was one of the things where we had to contiouslsy change with trial and error. From the WODs and Assignments, it allowed me to build basic knowledge of the syntac to more complex algorithm like Assignmnet 1 and Assignmnet 2, where I was able to demostrate a good amount of my knowledge and implementation with for example login and authentication. 

Although I have not mastered any of the langauges, being able to learn and improve as I was taking the class really helped me learn some new skills that I am good at and bad at.

**Understanding why MIS people need basic programming skills and knowledge**
I persoanlly think the reason why MIS people need basic programming skills and knowledge is to know how to address any issues that may come our way in the future with web designing or how to analyze a problem. From this class, I can safely say that I have been able to now solve problems when it comes to me and also testing to see why or where I went wrong. An example could be a code loop that I wrote for a Wod that took me maybe 7 - 10 tries. 

From all of my classes I would say this class is highly important when it comes to knowing the knowledge of basic programming skills and knowledge for MIS majors or people. Being able to problem solve a code or troubleshoot along the way during a job or internship seems to be helpful. Overall being able to decipher things and explain back to a potential custoemr is also importnat 

**Gaining hands-on experience in developing software applications**
I think all of the things we have done from labs to WODs to Assignmnets have really allowed me to gain those hands on experiences. From WODs, I was able to watch how to do things and learn from what I could have done differently or work to improve the code. 

Using Labs and Assignments on the other hand felt more like it was all instructional and would be guided half way and then we would be told to have to learn the information while we are taking our time to devlop software applications. Just because there was small sections where we are told to have to " do it on our own". 

From this, I think it really helped me problem solve and think on my own because everyone has a different way of applying a code and it can be done in so many different ways so figuring out my rytheme or the steps that work the best with me was the most valuble lesson I had learned. 

**Experiencing first-hand MIS problems and solutions**
From my personal experience, I felt like I had esxperienced so much first-hand MIS problems that I couldnt figure out until I divided all the steps one by one. From finding small mispelled sytax to inproper placements to even possibly the wrong file. The biggest hardship that I had encountered was my spelling. 

When I first started this class, I would even spell the word localhost wrong and it frustrated me when i was trying to load the server. Now, I felt lik I am able to detect those small spelling mistakes. 

**Experiencing and understanding first-hand project management, working in teams, software development issues**
From the firtst hand project managment and team working, I realized how time is very valuble when it comes to anything. Although it took me so long to realize, It helped me manage my time when It came to testings the proejcts like Assignment 1. I used a check list to mark down thigs that I had done and made sure to complete a certain part of the project before moving to the next. An example could me adding the home.html then home.js in cocurence updating the server. 

Especially without the help of my collaboartion with my teamartes or fellow classmates, I do not think i would have been able to strive in the class. Working with a team help me get more ideas or another prospective on how to make the code I have better.

**Gaining confidence in addressing MIS problems**
 During the course, I started feeling more confident about dealing with MIS problems. At first, I was unsure about how to handle these issues. But as I faced different challenges, like fixing code mistakes or figuring out server problems, I learned ways to solve them step by step. I got better at breaking down big problems into smaller ones that I could manage. By using online guides, talking with classmates, and trying different solutions, I improved at finding what was causing the problem and fixing it. While I still have more to learn, I now feel better prepared to handle MIS problems and not get too stressed out about them.


**What did you learn from creating a professional portfolio and using it in ITM 352?**
Creating a professional portfolio in ITM 352 helped me understand how to showcase my skills and experiences for future job opportunities. I learned how to use GitHub to create and edit my portfolio. I also got familiar with JSON and YAML notation, which are used to structure data online. By writing essays and adding project descriptions, I learned how to communicate my achievements effectively. Making sure my portfolio was publicly accessible taught me how to check URLs and fix any errors. Contributing to the MIS Portfolios Gallery showed me how to be part of a community of learners and professionals. Overall, this assignment helped me learn practical skills for my future career in MIS.

**What did you gain from doing the WODs?**
Doing the WODs helped me learn web development skills efficiently. Each WOD had clear instructions and a demonstration to follow. I learned to manage my time effectively to meet the Rx time. By practicing consistently, I improved my coding speed and accuracy. The WODs also introduced me to new tools and techniques, like using Chrome Developer Tools and working with CSS. Overall, the WODs provided valuable hands-on experience that enhanced my understanding of web development concepts..

Also from WODs it helped me grasp the knowledge more as I had to focus on creating a website with syntax and functions like the spinning loop for the products. It really also helped as I gained knowledge on how to follow the insturctions to the smallest detail.

**Were the quizzes helpful in preparing you for the labs?**
The quizzes didn't contribute much to my preparation for the labs because the labs were more hands-on. While the quizzes provided theoretical knowledge, the labs required practical application of concepts. I found that actively engaging in the lab exercises was the most effective way for me to learn and understand the material. The hands-on nature of the labs allowed me to experiment, make mistakes, and learn from them, which I found more beneficial than the passive nature of the quizzes.

**What did you learn from doing the labs?**
From the labs, I gained practical knowledge in handling cookies and sessions within Node.js and Express.js applications. Through exercises like setting and retrieving cookies, managing sessions, and implementing user authentication mechanisms, I deepened my understanding of web development concepts. These hands-on activities enabled me to grasp the significance of cookies and sessions in maintaining user state across different pages and sessions. Additionally, I learned about session persistence, session destruction, and how to leverage cookies and sessions for enhancing security and personalization on e-commerce websites. Overall, the labs provided valuable insights and practical experience that will be beneficial for building robust and secure web applications in the future.

**What did you learn from doing Assignment 1 and Assignment 2?**
Assignment 1 really pushed me to create a website that not only looked good but also worked smoothly behind the scenes. I had to craft web pages using HTML and CSS, making them visually appealing and easy to navigate. Then came the tricky part: making everything interactive. With Node.js and Express, I had to handle user input, process it on the server, and generate dynamic content. It was all about ensuring that the website could handle whatever the user threw at it, from selecting products to calculating totals.

Testing was a big part of the process too. I had to make sure that everything worked as expected and that there were no bugs lurking in the code. It taught me the importance of thorough testing and debugging, as even small mistakes could cause big problems.

Assignment 2 took things to the next level by focusing on security and user experience. I had to implement user registration and login systems, which meant encrypting passwords and keeping sensitive information safe. It was a real eye-opener to the importance of security in web development.

Personalization was another key aspect of Assignment 2. I had to make sure that the website could recognize users and tailor the experience to their needs. It was all about making the website feel more welcoming and user-friendly.

Overall, both assignments were challenging but incredibly rewarding. They taught me a lot about web development and gave me the skills I need to build robust, secure, and user-friendly websites.

**Challenges and Achievements**
Learning to code has been both exciting and tough. One of my biggest challenges was understanding coding syntax. It felt like a maze of rules and symbols that I struggled to navigate. This often left me feeling overwhelmed and unsure if I could ever really understand it.

To overcome this, I broke things down into smaller parts and focused on learning one thing at a time. I also used lots of resources like tutorials and forums to get help. Connecting with other learners and asking questions helped a lot too.

Despite the challenges, I'm proud of the progress I've made. Every line of code I write feels like an accomplishment. I've learned that overcoming obstacles makes me stronger, and I'm excited to keep learning and improving.

Some of my biggest challenges would be not being able to understand what syntax I am putting into my code. I had the hardest time developing because I didn't know what I was fully doing or learning.
