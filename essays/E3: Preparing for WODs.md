*Introduction*
In summary, I've completed the following WOD modules: Browser History 6, SmartPhoneProducts 1, and Invoice 1. While some took longer than expected, the knowledge gained was invaluable. I highly recommend thoroughly watching and reviewing all notes and modules before beginning. The main objectve I feel like was to create functions annd present data that was organized using HTML. 

## Browser History 6
The BrowserHistory6 project modifies an existing webpage layout to create a dynamic navigation system. The main page, index.html, introduces the history of browsers and features three buttons labeled "FireFox," "Chrome," and "Internet Explorer." Each button links to separate HTML files containing detailed histories for each browser. Additionally, when hovering over a button, a corresponding browser icon is displayed below the buttons. The project utilizes CSS to style the text with yellow color on a black background for improved readability. Overall, it enhances user experience and navigation through browser history content.

## SmartPhoneProducts 1
The SmartPhoneProducts1_variables project introduces variables to dynamically display smartphone product information on a webpage. By utilizing JavaScript variables for product names, prices, and image URLs, the webpage eliminates hard-coded data, making it easier to maintain and update. The display replicates the layout of SmartPhoneProducts1, with each product's name, price, and image being dynamically inserted into the appropriate sections. Additionally, a separate JavaScript file, products_data.js, stores the variable declarations for better organization. Upon loading the page, the console confirms successful loading of product variables. This implementation enhances the webpage's flexibility and ease of maintenance.

## Invoice 1 
The Invoice1 WOD aims to dynamically generate a sales receipt using JavaScript expressions and variables. By avoiding hard-coded values, the receipt can adapt to changes in product details while accurately calculating totals. The completed invoice displays essential information for at least five products, including item names, quantities, prices, and extended prices. It also computes the subtotal, sales tax, and grand total, ensuring precise financial calculations. The receipt is presented in an HTML table format, offering a clear and organized layout for easy comprehension. Throughout the task, challenges such as structuring JavaScript code for table generation were encountered, but proper use of string templates and document.write() facilitated the creation of dynamic rows. Overall, the Invoice1 WOD reinforces proficiency in JavaScript and demonstrates the ability to create functional, dynamic web content.

## Thank You
Some can get long but I highly recommend trying to do it first wihtout the timer then doing it. My biggest one was the Invoice 1 where I kept on making small mistakes. I feel like my experience with them was time consuming because I kept on making small errors that led to big errors. What I did differently was try to do it before hand and then try the WODS. The other would be making sure I am prepare.Reflecting on the experience, I acknowledge the importance of practicing more complex JavaScript tasks to enhance proficiency. To be better prepared for future WODs, I plan to spend more time exploring advanced JavaScript concepts and practicing problem-solving techniques. Additionally, I aim to experiment with different strategies, such as reading through all instructions before starting and organizing reference materials systematically, to streamline the execution process and improve efficiency.
